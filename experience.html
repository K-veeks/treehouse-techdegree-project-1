        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>I have always loved technology from as early as I could remember with my first user experience being an old Mac desktop in elementary school.  At the time using floppy disks was still popular and then we started to use usbs.  I remember how drastic of a change technology went through during my elementary to high school years with the release of the ipod nano, iphone, the growth of google and youtube, and so much more.</p>
        <p>I went to high school taking lessons in keyboarding and learned a  bit of basic computer cybersecurity through a club called Cyberpatriot for 2 years. From there I went to college for Computer Science initially and I did enjoy it, I got to learn html, CSS, some C++, and more as a result of it. Sadly for a variety of reasons and for the sake of keeping a long story short, I never ended up finishing my degree.</p>
        <p> Fast forward a few years I ended up reconnecting with my father and got a job as a coffee shop barista and now I am here, learning on treehouse about web design lol.</p>
